# Scribosermo STT Setup

[Scribosermo](https://gitlab.com/Jaco-Assistant/Scribosermo) is a LGPL licensed, open-source speech recognition engine to "Train fast Speech-to-Text networks in different languages".  
  
[Evaluation tests for German language](https://github.com/domcross/german-stt-evaluation) suggest that it's currently one of the fastest and most accurate open-source STT systems.
  
This repository trys to offer build scripts to run and test Scribosermo on different platforms focussing on Raspberry Pi SBC.
Ultimately the goal is to build a module for [SEPIA STT-Server](https://github.com/SEPIA-Framework/sepia-stt-server).
